# Creating an Optimal weights Portfolio (Modern Portfolio theory)

This project encompasses a comprehensive approach to portfolio management, risk assessment, and time series forecasting. Leveraging Python and advanced data analysis techniques, I developed a robust tool capable of optimizing portfolios, managing risk through Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) measures, and forecasting portfolio returns using time series models. The project integrates modern portfolio theory principles and time series analysis to provide actionable insights for investment decision-making. By employing libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, I facilitated efficient data manipulation, modeling, and visualization. This project showcases my expertise in quantitative finance, data analysis, time series forecasting, and programming skills.This project encompasses a comprehensive approach to portfolio management, risk assessment, and time series forecasting.
